# Formula-1-Stats

Formula 1 Stats is a data visualization project that would allow the user to visualize
the most successful teams (car brands) over a period of time and top circuits in the
world. It would also show a comparison between various drivers who were active over
a period of time. This project would include three main visualizations:
1. Showing the most successful teams over a period of time and the respective
drivers who represented those teams in those years.

2. A comparative visualization between driver statistics who were active over a
period of years.

3. Showing a map visualization of all the regions in the world that have formula 1
circuits (race tracks). This part would also show the top circuits in the world
on map.
